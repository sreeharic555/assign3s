			<h1><u>Sequences</u></h1>

			<p >
				A sequence is a list of objects (or events) which have been ordered in a sequential fashion; such that each member either comes before, or after, every other member. More formally, a sequence is a function with a domain equal to the set of positive integers. 
			</p>

			<h1><u>Series</u></h1>

			<p >
				A series is a sum of a sequence of terms. That is, a series is a list of numbers with addition operations between them. 
			</p>


<h1 id="seqheadone"><u>Types</u></h1>

			

<h1><u>Arithmetic Sequences</u></h1>

			<p >
				A sequence in which every term is created by adding or subtracting a definite number to the preceding number is an arithmetic sequence
			</p>


<h1><u>Geometric Sequences</u></h1>

			<p >
				A sequence in which every term is obtained by multiplying or dividing a definite number with the preceding number is known as a geometric sequence. 
			</p>


<h1><u>Harmonic Sequences</u></h1>

			<p >
				A series of numbers is said to be in harmonic sequence if the reciprocals of all the elements of the sequence form an arithmetic sequence.
			</p>


<h1><u>Fibonacci Numbers</u></h1>

			<p >
				Fibonacci numbers form an interesting sequence of numbers in which each element is obtained by adding two preceding elements and the sequence starts with 0 and 1. Sequence is defined as, F<sub>0</sub> = 0 and F<sub>1</sub> = 1 and F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>
